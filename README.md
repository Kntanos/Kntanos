<p>Before coding became my new passion, I trained and worked for 12 years as a Conservation Scientist, eventually leading a team of scientists and conservators that looked after a vast collection of mainly paper-based materials in one of the world's biggest archives. I left that role in 2018 to pursue a more creative path and satisfy my desire to keep learning and creating new things.
  
Starting in 2017, I developed a small online creative business. Being largely self-taught, I had to learn how to quickly pick up new knowledge and diligently putting it into practice. A lot of the new areas of knowledge that I had to navigate, reignited my interest in software development, so as soon as I had the opportunity to act on it, I did!

In September 2021 I joined the Makers Academy on the 16-week full-time software development course</p>
